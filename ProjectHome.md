This is the server part of the Android App MobileWebCam to view your webcam pictures in an organized way or as timelapse video.

Upload the files to your server via ftp. Then edit .htaccess and password file to protect your directory. Add YOURURL/cam.php to mobilewebcam and start taking pictures.

Visit gallery.php to view all the pictures a little more organized (sorted by day) or view daily timelapses with the mjpeg below.

Please let me know if you have improvements and want to share!
